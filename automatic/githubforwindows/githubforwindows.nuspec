GitHub for Windows includes a fully functional version of msysGit — no need to install anything extra. You can pull up a PowerShell console within the context of any repository. GitHub for Windows even includes the amazing posh-git utility for your command line pleasure.

### Connecting to GitHub.com

In most cases you don’t even need SSH keys. All repositories are cloned over HTTPS by default, and GitHub for Windows caches your credentials so you don’t have to keep entering your password for every remote action, even on the command line.

For cases where you have an existing repository using an SSH remote, GitHub for Windows will seamlessly set up SSH for you. You will get an email and see a new key added to your account.

### Adding repositories

You can add any repository already on your hard drive by dragging the folder in from Explorer. If that folder is a Git repository, GitHub for Windows will import all of the history and connect it to your GitHub account.

Another great way to add repositories is to clone them directly from GitHub. You can do that right in the application by browsing through your personal account or any organizations you belong to. You can also clone with one click from any repository page on GitHub. Just look for the Clone in Desktop button.
