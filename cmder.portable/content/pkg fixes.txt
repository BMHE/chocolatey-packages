Incorrectly tried to fix with previous version

=============
ERROR Message
=============
clink_x64.exe - System Error
The program can't start because MSVCR100.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.
=============

CAUSE
clink is the launcher used for cmder.

A dependency of it is Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package 
vcredist_x64.exe
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14632

Issue with initial fix
Thought I was trying to fix a .NET error, specifically:
Windows 8/8.1/2012/2012r2 includes .NET 4.0/4.5
Applications that specifically require a previous .NET versions such as  2.5, 3.0, or 3.5 are available via dism.


SOLVED
Add dependency vcredist2010
Remove dependency DotNet3.5
